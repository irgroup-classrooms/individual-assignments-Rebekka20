GANDALF,Get up ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,My lord there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now     War is coming The enemy is on your doorstep As steward you are charged     with the defence of this city Where are Gondors armies You still have     friends You are not alone in this fight Send word to Theoden of Rohan     Light the beacons ,The Return of the King 
DENETHOR,You think you are wise Mithrandir Yet for all your subtleties you have     not wisdom Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind I have seen     more than you know With your left hand you would use me as a shield against     Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me I know who rides     with Theoden of Rohan Oh yes word has reached my ears of this Aragorn son     of Arathorn And I tell you now I will not bow to this Ranger from the     North Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship  ,The Return of the King

DENETHOR,The rule of Gondor is mine and no others ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,Come ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,All had turned to vain ambition He would use even his grief as a cloak     A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will     fall And the white tree the tree of the King will never bloom again ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,A wizard is never late Frodo Baggins     Nor is he early he arrives precisely when he means     to       ,The Fellowship of the Ring

FRODO,Half the Shires been invited     And the rest of them are turning up anyway  ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
BILBO VOICEOVER,And so life in the Shire goes on very much as it has     this past age  Full of its own comings and goings with change coming     slowly if it comes at all For things are made to endure in     the Shire passing from one generation to the next Theres always been a     Baggins living here under the Hill in Bag End        ,The Fellowship of the Ring

PIPPIN,Why are they still guarding it  ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,They guard it because they have hope A faint and fading hope that one     day it will flower That a king will come and this city will be as it once     was before it fell into decay      The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken Kings made tombs more     splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their     descent  dearer than the names of their sons         Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high cold towers     asking questions of the stars And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin         The line of Kings failed The white tree withered The rule of Gondor was     given over to lesser men,The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,Mordor ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,Yes there it lies This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow ,The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,A storm is coming ,The Return of the King 
GANDALF,This is not the weather of the world This is a device of Saurons     making A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host The Orcs of Mordor have     no love of daylight so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage     along the road to war When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will     begin ,The Return of the King 
PIPPIN,Well Minas Tirith very impressive So where are off to next ,The Return of the King

GANDALF,Hes been following us for three days ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
FRODO,He escaped the dungeons of BaradDr ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
GANDALF,Escaped      or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here       He wont ever be rid of his need for it  He hates and loves the Ring     as he hates and loves himself  Smeagols life is a sad story      Yes     he was once called before the Ring     found him Before it drove him mad ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
FRODO,Its a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
GANDALF,Pity   It was pity that stayed Bilbos hand      Many that live deserve death and many that die deserve life Can you give     it to them Frodo  Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even     the very wise cannot see all ends  My heart tells me that Gollum has     some part to play yet for good or ill before this is over          The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many  ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
FRODO,I wish the Ring had never come to me  I wish none of     this had happened ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
GANDALF,So do all who live to see such times but that is not for     them to decide  All we have to decide is what to do with the time that     is given to us  There are other forces at work in this world Frodo     besides the will of evil  Bilbo was meant to find the Ring in which     case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought        Oh Its that way ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
BARLIMAN,Good Evening little masters  What can I do for you      If youre looking for accomodation weve got some nice cosy hobbit sized     rooms available  Always proud to cater to the little folk Mr err  ,The Fellowship of the Ring

FRODO,What are they  ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
STRIDER,They were once men Great Kings of Men  The Sauron     the Deciever  gave to them nine rings of power Blinded by their greed     they took them without question One by one falling into darkness    Now they are slaves to his will They are     the Nazgl Ringwraiths  Neither living nor dead At all times they     feel the presence of the Ring  Drawn to the power of the One     They     will never stop hunting you ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
FRODO,Where are you taking us  ,The Fellowship of the Ring

GANDALF,He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring Weve been strangely fortunate Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse     of the enemys plan Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith    ,The Return of the King 
GAN DALF,His defeat at Helms Deep showed our enemy one thing     He knows the Heir of     Elendil has come forth      Men are not as weak as he supposed There is courage still Strength enough     perhaps to challenge him Sauron fears this He will not risk the peoples     of Middle Earth uniting under one banner  He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground     before he     sees a King return to the throne of men If the beacons of Gondor are lit     Rohan must be ready for war ,The Return of the King
